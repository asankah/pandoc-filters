title: Example document with Wiki style links
---

All the links here are based on what's used by [`VimWiki`](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki/blob/master/doc/vimwiki.txt).

* A basic link looks like `[[WikiLink]]`: [[WikiLink]]
* A link with a separate description can be specified as `[[Link Source|description]]`: [[Link Source|Description]]
* A link source can include a fragment like `[[WikiLink#section]]` or `[[link source#section|description]]`: [[WikiLink#section]] or [[link source#section|description]]
* There can be multiple space separated components like in `[[this one has several spaces in-between]]`: [[this one has several spaces in-between]]
* But they can't contain formatting like in `[[foo bar **something**]]`: [[foo bar **something**]]
* Or like in `[[**something**]]`: [[**something**]]
